Hello, I am a Flutter developer with experience building mobile apps for both iOS and Android using Dart programming language. I have experience working with Android Studio and Xcode, and have a strong understanding of the Flutter framework and its features. 

My skills include:

- Implementing complex logic and data storage using Dart, also making use of various libraries and plugins available.
- Integrating with RESTful APIs and Firebase, to provide a seamless user experience.
